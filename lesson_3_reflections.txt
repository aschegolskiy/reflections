When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would like to do so when I need to backup my code. I used to manually copy
    and paste code onto the Github Gists, but it's very annoying doing it every
    time, especially when the project is growing bigger and bigger(I can only
    view diff, but can't write commit messages).

    Also, when I need to switch working computers often, that's when I would like
    to use a remote repo.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
